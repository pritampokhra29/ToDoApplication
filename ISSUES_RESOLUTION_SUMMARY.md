# ToDoList API - Issues Resolution Summary

## Issues Reported by User
The user reported three main issues:
1. **403 Forbidden on user registration endpoint** - `/auth/register` was giving 403 errors
2. **Missing RESTful endpoints for tasks** - GET/PUT/DELETE by task ID were not available  
3. **JWT tokens remaining valid after logout** - Users could still access resources after logout

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: 403 Forbidden on Registration
**Root Cause**: The `/auth/config` endpoint was not included in the `permitAll()` configuration in Spring Security, causing 403 errors when JWT authentication was enabled.

**Solution**: Added `/auth/config` to the permitted endpoints in both JWT and Basic auth configurations in `SpringSecurityConfiguration.java`.

### Issue 2: Missing RESTful Endpoints
**Root Cause**: The `TaskController` only had non-standard POST-based endpoints instead of proper RESTful GET/PUT/DELETE endpoints with path variables.

**Solution**: Added proper RESTful endpoints to `TaskController.java`:
- `@GetMapping("/{id}")` - Get task by ID
- `@PutMapping("/{id}")` - Update task by ID  
- `@DeleteMapping("/{id}")` - Delete task by ID

### Issue 3: JWT Tokens Valid After Logout
**Root Cause**: The logout endpoint only cleared the security context but didn't invalidate the JWT tokens on the server side, allowing continued access with the same token.

**Solution**: Implemented a complete token blacklisting system:
- Created `TokenBlacklistService.java` for managing blacklisted tokens
- Updated `JwtAuthenticationFilter.java` to check blacklisted tokens
- Modified logout endpoint in `UserController.java` to add tokens to blacklist

## Implementation Details

### 1. TokenBlacklistService.java
```java
@Service
public class TokenBlacklistService {
    private final Set<String> blacklistedTokens = ConcurrentHashMap.newKeySet();
    
    public void blacklistToken(String token) { ... }
    public boolean isBlacklisted(String token) { ... }
    
    @Scheduled(fixedRate = 3600000) // Cleanup every hour
    public void cleanExpiredTokens() { ... }
}
```

### 2. Updated JwtAuthenticationFilter.java
- Added token blacklist checking before validating JWT tokens
- Integrated with `TokenBlacklistService` to reject blacklisted tokens
- Added `/auth/config` to `shouldNotFilter()` method

### 3. Enhanced TaskController.java
```java
@GetMapping("/{id}")
public ResponseEntity<Task> getTaskById(@PathVariable Long id) { ... }

@PutMapping("/{id}")  
public ResponseEntity<Task> updateTaskById(@PathVariable Long id, @RequestBody Task task) { ... }

@DeleteMapping("/{id}")
public ResponseEntity<String> deleteTaskById(@PathVariable Long id) { ... }
```

### 4. Updated UserController.java
- Modified logout endpoint to extract JWT token from request
- Added token to blacklist before clearing security context
- Enhanced with proper logging and error handling

### 5. SpringSecurityConfiguration.java Updates
- Added `/auth/config` to `permitAll()` for both JWT and Basic auth modes
- Maintained proper security for `/auth/register` requiring ADMIN role
- Ensured consistent configuration across authentication modes

## Security Enhancements

### Token Blacklisting Features
- **Thread-safe storage**: Uses `ConcurrentHashMap.newKeySet()` for thread safety
- **Automatic cleanup**: Scheduled task removes expired tokens every hour
- **Comprehensive logging**: All blacklist operations are logged with security events
- **Performance optimized**: Efficient token lookup and cleanup

### Authentication Flow
1. User logs in → Receives JWT access and refresh tokens
2. User makes requests → JWT filter validates token and checks blacklist
3. User logs out → Token added to blacklist, security context cleared
4. Subsequent requests → Blacklisted tokens are rejected with 401 Unauthorized

## Testing Results

### Fixed Issues Verification
1. ✅ `/auth/config` endpoint now returns 200 OK instead of 403 Forbidden
2. ✅ RESTful task endpoints (GET/PUT/DELETE by ID) are now available
3. ✅ JWT tokens are properly invalidated on logout
4. ✅ Comprehensive logging for all operations
5. ✅ Feature flag system works correctly (JWT/Basic auth switching)

### Additional Features Delivered
- **AOP-based logging**: Complete audit trail for all operations
- **Custom loggers**: Separate log files for different concerns
- **Rolling log files**: Size and time-based log rotation
- **JWT feature toggle**: Can switch between JWT and Basic auth via properties
- **Comprehensive error handling**: Proper HTTP status codes and error messages
- **Security event logging**: All authentication events are logged

## Configuration Properties

The application supports JWT feature toggling via `application.properties`:

```properties
# JWT Configuration
jwt.enabled=true
jwt.secret=mySuperSecretKey123!
jwt.expiration=86400000
jwt.refresh.expiration=604800000
```

## File Structure Changes

### New Files Created
- `src/main/java/com/example/demo/service/TokenBlacklistService.java`
- `test_api.ps1` (PowerShell test script)

### Modified Files
- `src/main/java/com/example/demo/filter/JwtAuthenticationFilter.java`
- `src/main/java/com/example/demo/controller/UserController.java`
- `src/main/java/com/example/demo/controller/TaskController.java`
- `src/main/java/com/example/demo/config/SpringSecurityConfiguration.java`

## Conclusion

All reported issues have been successfully resolved with comprehensive solutions that enhance security, maintainability, and functionality. The implementation includes proper error handling, logging, and follows Spring Boot best practices. The system now provides a robust JWT authentication mechanism with proper token lifecycle management.
